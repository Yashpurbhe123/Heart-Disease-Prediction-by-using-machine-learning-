**Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**
This project aims to predict heart disease using four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. By comparing their accuracies, we identify the most effective model for heart disease prediction.

**Key Steps in the Project:**

**1=Data Loading and Exploration:**
The dataset is loaded and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand its structure and key statistics.

**2=Data Preprocessing:**
Target variable separation and feature extraction.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

**3=Model Training:**
Various machine learning algorithms are applied to train models on the training data.
Performance of the models is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

**4=Model Evaluation:**
The trained models are tested on the testing data to assess their predictive accuracy.
Results are analyzed to determine the best performing model for heart disease prediction.

The ultimate goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention for heart disease, potentially saving lives through timely treatment.
