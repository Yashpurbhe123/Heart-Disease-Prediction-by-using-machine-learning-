# Heart-Disease-Prediction-by-using-machine-learning-
This project aims to predict heart disease using four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. By comparing their accuracies, we identify the most effective model for heart disease prediction.
